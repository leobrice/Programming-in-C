/***********  CS 174: PROGRAMMING IN C  ***************/
LAB SESSION 6

Lab Q19	
	Write a program that accepts marks for students in an array, 
	the size of the array to be given by the user
Lab Q20 
	From the array above compute from the mean mark.

Lab Q21
	Write a programme, using arrays, that accepts marks of a test from a number
	of students marks (the number of students to be provided by the user) and 
	deduct 7 from each. 
Lab Q22
	If the resulting mark after deduction in Q21 above is less than 40,
	it should set the marks to 40

Lab Q23
	From the array in 15 above calculate the average deviation from the mean. 
	Thus if, for example, the mean was 50, the program is to compute the 
	difference of each mark and 50 and add these differences and later find 
	their average

Lab Q24
	Write a program that accepts marks from 20 students for two subjects. 
	Note: Use iterative controls to manage that.
