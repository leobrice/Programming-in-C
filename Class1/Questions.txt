Lab Exercise 2 - Operators
*******************************************************************************

Question 1
	Write a program that asks for the age of the user and compute the year they were born

Question 2
	Write a program that asks the user for the length of the side of a square and the program should compute the perimeter of the square and its area. 
	The output on the screen should be something like --- 	"The Area is 24 sq. cm, and the Perimeter is 18cm" (24 and 18 are examples only)

Question 3
	Write a program that takes from the user the radius of a circle and the program should compute the area of the circle and its circumference. 
	The Output on the screen should look like this: "The Area is 56 sq. cm and Circumference is 28cm"

Question 4
	Write a program that accepts from the user the values for PRINCIPLE, INTEREST RATE, AND TIME and the program should then compute the Simple Interest

Question 5
	Write a program that takes in an integer number and prints out the remainder, if that number is divided by 3
