/***********   174: PROGRAMMING IN C  ***************/
LAB SESSION 7

Lab Q25
	- declare a float variable
	- assign 37.22 to the variable
	- declare a pointer variable of type float
	- assign the address of the first variable to the pointer variable
	- print out the value of the first variable by dereferencing the pointer
	
Lab Q26
	Complete the following C program to print the contents of the array using 	pointers

	#include<stdio.h>
	main(){
	int k;
	float thearr[] = {2.5, 5, 6.7, 10, 13.3, 25, 0};
	...
	...
	}

Lab Q27
	Populate the array "multiarr" with the elements in the array "thearr" by multiplying each element in "thearr" by 3.
	Use pointers to perform the multication of "thearr" array elements
	#include<stdio.h>
	main(){
	int k;
	float multiarr[7];
	float thearr[] = {2.5, 5, 6.7, 10, 13.3, 25, 0};
	...
	...
	}
